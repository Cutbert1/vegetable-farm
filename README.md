# Vegetable Farm
## Introduction
#### Project Description
  Vegetable Farm is a statistical collection project to enable vegetable farmers collect details of daily sales of thirteen different vegetables types being cultivated on a farm (cabbage, carrot, mushroom, broccoli, cauliflower, avocado, asparagus, aubergine, tomato, cucumber, spinach, parsnip and onion). To understand and forecast daily vegetable harvest with reference to daily trade and excess. Excess references amount of each vegetable type sold out with more required to be harvested or more vegetable harvested than what was sold hence wasted as vegetables are highly perishable produce. This will enable the farmer provide fresh vegetable to customers and improved vegetable shelf life.

#### User Demographic
Vegetable farm data automation can be used by small to medium size vegetable farmers 
#### How to Use
Vegetable farm data automation is based on gathering statistical data used to improve farmers harvest forecast for longer vegetable shelf life.

Step 1. Run the program

Step 2. Enter trade data, collection of 13 numeric integers separated with commas

Step 3. Hit enter to run the program

Step 4. Trade worksheet auto Update

Step 5. Excess worksheet auto Update

Step 6. Harvest worksheet auto Update

Step 7. Print harvest forecast on terminal for next day

## Features
### Existing Features
#### Error handling:

      * Input must be numeric integers

      * Input must be collection of 13 numeric integers separated with commas

* Trade worksheet updated when valid record is entered

* Excess calculated and worksheet updated

* Harvest forecast calculated and worksheet updated

* Next day harvest forecast printed to terminal

### Future Features

* Forecast harvest numbers for a longer period and seasons, e.g. summer, 
  Christmas etc using average trade, harvest and excess data for several weeks.

* Convert vegetables to be weighed in tonnes  

## Data Model
The data type requirement are numeric integers. A collection of thirteen integers separated with commas, this classifies thirteen columns of farmerâ€™s vegetables types as stated in google sheet. Trade input data __must__ be equals to thirteen collection of numeric integers separated with commas and __must__ not contain any other data type.

Daily excess is calculated by subtracting trade from harvest. Harvest forecast calculated is calculated using average  trade for last week (7 days) and a markup of 20%.

## Validation Testing
Manually tested this project by passing the code through a [PEP8 Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) and confirmed there are no Warning or Error.

### Languages Used
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
## Bugs
#### Bugs Resolved
* For get_last_week_trade function column count, initially used range(0, 12) to pull last 7 days trade data for 13 vegetable columns thinking that function works just lists zero index. However this was not pulling trade data for all 13 columns. 
It was fixed by using range (1, 14)

#### Bugs Unresolved
There are no unresolved bug
## Deployment
### Deployment Steps

* To enable Heroku build the project, create dependency list on requirement.txt file in workspace using pip3 freeze > requirements.txt command

   ![requirements](./assets/readme-images/requirements.jpg)

* Sign into Heroku and create a new app.

    ![create new app](./assets/readme-images/create%20app.png)

* Add App name (vegetable-farm) and choose region (Europe)
  
* Go to settings tab to add Config Var

   ![settings](./assets/readme-images/settings.png)
      
* Add credential json KEY and VALUE

   ![credential](./assets/readme-images/configvars.jpg)

* Add another config Var to set KEY as PORT and VALUE as 8000

   ![port](./assets/readme-images/port.jpg)

* Go to Deploy tab to continue deployment
